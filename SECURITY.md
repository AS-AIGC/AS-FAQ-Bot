# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it as soon as possible. We take all security reports seriously and will address them promptly.

## Steps to Report a Vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** To protect the project and its users, we request that security vulnerabilities are reported via private communication.
2. **Email us at cclljj@gmail.com** with the following information:
    - A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
    - Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept).
    - Any other relevant information that will help us to understand the issue.
3. **You will receive an acknowledgement within 48 hours.** We will work with you to understand the issue and develop a fix.
4. **We will provide you with an estimated time frame for the fix.** During this period, we may ask you for further information or feedback.

## What We Do Next

Upon receiving your report, we will:

1. Investigate the vulnerability to confirm its existence and impact.
2. Work on a patch to fix the vulnerability.
3. Notify the affected users and prepare a release with the fix.
4. Credit you for the discovery if you wish, and if the vulnerability is confirmed and fixed.

## Public Disclosure

We will not publicly disclose the details of the vulnerability until we have provided a patch and updated all affected versions. We believe this approach is the best way to protect our users.
